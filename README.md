# Portfolio
I'm Madhumitha and this is my personal portfolio website 
This portfolio website was created as a learning project to explore and strengthen my skills in web development. Through building this site, I gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, and deepened my understanding of front-end design principles and responsive layout techniques
